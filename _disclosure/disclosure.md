We informed MEGA about the vulnerabilities in their system on 29 September 2022, which MEGA acknowledged on 30 September 2022. We suggested mitigations, stressing the importance of providing proper cryptographic integrity for data stored under users' master keys. We recommended auditing or replacing [MEGA's asmcrypto.js](https://github.com/meganz/webclient/blob/v4.21.4/js/vendor/asmcrypto.js), the low-level library used by the MEGA webclient (an old, custom copy of [asmcrypto.js](https://github.com/asmcrypto/asmcrypto.js)), in which we found several bugs during our analysis. MEGA informed us about their planned overhaul of the protocol that should address the issues we highlighted and we provided feedback. Given the scale of the changes, we agreed to extend the original 90-day disclosure period. On 6 March 2023, MEGA published a [blogpost](https://blog.mega.io/e2ee-security-update/) detailing their client software upgrade. MEGA awarded a bug bounty.

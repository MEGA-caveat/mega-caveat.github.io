question: Are the attacks practical?

In their current form, they require the attacked user to log in hundreds of times, more than the original RSA key recovery attack of [Backendal, Haller and Paterson](https://mega-awry.io). However, as the work of [Ryan and Heninger](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/914) and our own optimisation of the original attack have shown, attacks that were previously thought impractical can quickly reach practical levels.

We looked at the official [MEGA Web Client](https://github.com/meganz/webclient) version 4.21.4. As per [MEGA's blogpost](https://blog.mega.io/e2ee-security-update/), the fixes were deployed in web client version 4.32.4. See the post for the versions of the official mobile and desktop clients that were also upgraded.
